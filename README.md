## About

Frontend developer with **10+ years** of commercial experience, collaborating in teams ranging from **2** to **20** members,
both remotely and on-site. I have **1+** year of experience in team leadership. I've built entire development workflows:
from collecting requirements to setting up automated releases with high test coverage, comprehensive analytics, and
CI/CD pipelines.

I've created custom UI libraries to make development faster and more consistent. I've improved load times and
performance by optimizing code and using smart caching. I helped build reliable and scalable front-end architecture with
modern tools and best practices.
